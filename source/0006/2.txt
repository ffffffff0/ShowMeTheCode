great deal of information can be gathered with much simpler and accessible tools. # " As any other social media website Twitter know a lot of things about you, thanks to metadata, " a French security researcher known as X0rz wrote in a recent blog post. " Indeed, for a 140 characters message you will get A LOT of metadata -- more than 20 times the size of the initial content you typed in! And guess what? Almost all of this metadata is accessible through the open Twitter API. " To demonstrate that, X0rz wrote a Python script called tweetsanalyzer, a command-line tool to tap into some of Twitter's vast metadata that may not be accessible from the standard client. # Tweetsanalyzer requires a Twitter account for authentication, as well as Twitter API credentials and, of course, a tweaked Python environment. It's not exactly something to be handed over blindly to the average tweeter. But in the right hands (and with a little patience due to Twitter API rate-limiting), it can help analyze accounts to identify networks of Twitter bots
